        Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 200, with two exceptions.
        For numbers divisible by 6, print "Shams" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 8 (and not 6),
        print "TIIDELAB" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "ShamsTIIDELAB" for numbers
        that are divisible by both 6 and 8 (and still print "Shams" or "TIIDELAB" for numbers divisible by only one of
        those).

        (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer
        candidates. So if you solved it, your labour market value just went up.)
